**ITIL version 3 foundations**

_ITIL Version 2 modules_

Service Support 

Service Delivery 

Business Perspective 

ICT Infrastructure Management 

Security Management 

Planning to Implement Service 

Management 

Application Management 

_Version 2 to Version 3 Comparison _

Version 2 

• 7 (9) titles in v2 

• Best Practices Standard for Service Management 

• Focus on Service Support and Service Delivery 

Version 3 

• 5 titles in v3 

• Best Practices Standard across many industries 

• Focus on lifecycle approach to service management 

With version 3 ITIL moves into several industries best practices.

V3 focuses much more on lifecycle approach (going through every phase)

**Service lifecycle parts**

Service Strategy 

Continual Service Improvement 

Service Operation

Service Design 

Service Transition 

ITIL continual service improvement parallels one of the seven habits of highly effective people: sharpen the souls (the processes that work today might not work tomorrow).

## Module 1 (Service management) - Continual service improvement

**Continual service improvement**

We need to keep scrutinise our processes cause technology keeps changing. We need to make sure that those processes are the most efficient.

Module 1 

Service Management: Business Requirements 

* Foundations and Cycles 
* PDCA Plan-Do-Check-Act and The Basics 
* The Process Model 
* RACI- Responsible (Accountable, Consulted, lnformed)

**Foundations and Cycles**

Foundations and Cycles 

COBIT 

ISO/IEC 20000 

ISO/IEC 15504 

ISO/IEC 19770:2006 

Management of Risk 

MOF 

Project Management 

CMMI 

Six Sigma 

ITIL Service Lifecycle 

COBIT: information system audit type framework

ISO/IEC 20000: working to promote the adoption of integrated process to deliver managing service to meet customer and business requirements

ISO/IEC 15504: framework for the assessment of process capabilities

ISO/IEC 19770:2006: enable org to prove that it is performing software assess management according to gov level

Management of risk: general framework for the management of risk across all parts of org

MOF: Microsoft operation framework. delivers guidance for everyday process practices

Project management: has its own cycle

CMMI: capability maturity model. demonstrates the maturity of software development process

Six sigma: DMAIC define measure analyse improve control

ITIL: five phases mentioned above

Many of these are complementary to ITIL

**Public vs Proprietary **

Differences in standards: 

_Public frameworks vs. proprietary knowledge _

Public frameworks and standards have advantages when compared with proprietary knowledge such as: 

* Proprietary knowledge is organization specific and therefore difficult to adopt or reproduce. 
* Proprietary knowledge is customized for the local context making it difficult to be applied to a broader scope. 

With ITIL: can be applied to several environments, it is highly distributed across orgs.

ITIL does not want to disrupt working process.

ITIL gives recommendation on how to approach service management.

**Plan-Do-Check-Act Cycle**

ITIL recommends plan do check act.

It is an iterative four step management method.

It is driven to provide control and continuos improvement of processes.

Wildly held and known as the Deming cycle

Plan 

Act

Check 

Do 

Adopted a lot of the continuos service improvement phase.

A phase of consolidation prevent the process from rolling down the hill. The activities are measured carefully for compliance with expected outcomes as a mean for improvement.

Plan: plan what process you want to design and what the aimed results are

Do: develop an approach for the implementation of the processes

Check: monitoring phase when you check if the results are accomplished. Then make recommendation for adjustments

Act: acting upon any process that needs to be fixed or removed

This is a continuous cycle, so after Act you go back to Plan

**Process model**

All processes should:

All processes require four characteristics: 

1.A process must be measurable: costs, performance, quality and value provided 

2.A process must consistently deliver specific results 

3.A process must meet its stakeholders or customers' expectations 

4.A process must respond to an event (known or unknown) 

Truth is not reality, perception is reality. The value that the customer is received has to be properly framed.

The IT side has to fully understand the expectations of the customer.

A process must respond to events or triggers. It might be unknown (catastrophic event).

**Core components**

A process should have 3 key components:

1\. Process Control ---a guiding policy, a process owner, measurements. 

2\. Process Catalysts --- appropriate resources and capabilities (people and tools) 

3\. The Process Outline --- steps of activities and specific roles to move inputs to desired outputs 

Control is one of the main points of contingency: without it, if the process is broken you do not know who to turn to. With ITIL V3 we make sure of it.

With the process catalysts we make sure we have the required resources to deliver on those processes. The process outline is the process itself

**Responsible-Accountable-Consulted-Informed**

_RACI: Organizational Structure _

RACI MODEL: 

Responsible 

- What needs to be done and by whom? 

Accountable 

- Who owns the results? 

Consulted 

Who has expertise to assist? 

Informed 

- Who needs to know (e.g. stakeholders)? 

Responsible: After a meeting is it important to note who will be the owner of the actions to take (who will take them).

Accountability: one point of contact with regard to processes that are in place. If there is a process glitch we know who owns the result. Everytime we make a change we need to have someone who owns the result

Consulted: allows to know where to go to find additional information

Informed: who needs to know about the results of a specific process.

**Guiding principles**

You won't manage what you cannot control 

You won't control what you cannot measure 

You won't measure what you cannot define 

Control deals with having a guidance policy, and/or a process owner.

The process can be measured in terms of costs and/or quality

The process itself needs to be clearly defined, so that it can be followed by who is involved in the process.

**Continual Service Improvement 7-Step Process **

Identify the strategy for improvement 

Define what you will measure 

Gather the data 

Process the data 

Analyze the information and data 

Present and use the information 

Implement improvement 

1\. Not change for the sake of changing, but always look for ways to improve the processes. Where to we need to improve and what is the strategy.

2\. Every process should be measurable

3\. How are we going to gather the data? In order to see a refinement of the process is giving the expected results

4\. Make the information usable. 

5\. Determine if it is working, and how it can be improved

6\. Present the information in different formats.

7\. Implement the improvement

**Terms**

Continual Service Improvement Terms 

Baseline 

CSI Model 

Metrics 

- Technology Metrics 

- Process Metrics 

- Service Metrics 

Baseline: initial data point to determine if a service process needs to be improved. Used to check the expectations from the customer or the stakeholder

CSI model: can assist in determining what can be improved and which method should be used

Technology metrics: the processes in terms of a hard drive: availability, performance, ..

Process metrics: critical success factor (CSF) associated with each factor, indicating which KPI need to be defined for the process

Service metrics: results of an end to end service
