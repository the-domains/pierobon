**__**

**_Project definition:_**

not formally part of the project. Business case is summarised as a project charter.

**_Key purpose:_**

identity benefits for the organisation, define enough for PM to develop a project plan, determine viability, identify risks, sanction project and assign PM

**_Key concepts:_**

project charter cannot change, contract between management and PM, PM and experts must be used to develop it

**_Elements:_**

goal statement, business objectives, deliverables, scope: inclusions and exclusions, PM and authority level, organisational resources, approach, risks, initial estimates

**_Project Scope definition:_**

includes Requirements definition and work definition

**_Requirements definition:_**

identity req and deliverable for the project to succeed, PM must satisfy all the stakeholders while satisfying the goals identified in the charter on a limited time and budget and schedule. 

**_Goals breakdown structure:_**

breaks down goals into smaller goals (provide complete set of goals, no unnecessary goals, for all the org)

**_Work definition:_**

WBS becomes the core of the project plan. many projects decompose by: 

_phase_

: not part of the project (arrange the work to allow PM oversights). It includes the creation of a set of deliverables. at the end of each there is a gate review that must be passed for the project to proceed

_Work package_

: work needed to create a well defined component of a deliverable (measurable by an outside organisation)

_Schedule activities_

: further optional level

**_Estimates_**

: PM needs to estimate effort and duration

_Concepts_

: early estimates: the sooner the in the project the more inaccurate the estimate

Project archives: learn from the previous project to get a better estimate

Accountability: the task performer knows better and can get enthusiastic about it

Task definition and size: the smaller and better defined the task, the easier to estimate

Effort vs Duration: the difference between the two is rarely under the PM control

_**Critical Path**_

: defines tasks that show the highest risk for schedule delay. If any of them is delayed the whole project is delayed of that amount.

It tells the PM where to put the best resources, which resource they can and cannot loose.

It is initially calculated using an unlimited resource pool, after having acquired real resource there is a recalculation (extension) called resource levelling. 

**_Supporting elements: _**

additional tool to make the project more resilient to interferences and risks

**_Risk management: _**

Projects are unique entities, so they have risks. Risk managements makes the project more resilient to external or internal events

_Monte carlo analysis:_

computer simulation of projects goals achieving (cost and schedule goals)

_Sensitivity analysis: _

computer simulation for determining which risks have the greatest effect on project cost, schedule and quality

**_Organizational and Resouce chart: _**

resource assignment matrix RAM (identifies which resource are doing which task)

**_Project Communication Plan: _**

describes how the PM will communicate to the other people related to the project. It includes communication requirements

_Communication Responsibility Matrix:_

shows who is suppose to communicate to whom and at which minimum frequency. (Prevents certain groups from interacting, to prevent erroneous flows of information)

_Resource or Staffing Management Plan: _

describe where and how the management team will acquire the appropriate staff.

_Procurement Plan:_

outlines the procedures and criteria for outsourcing project work and resources.

_Milestones and schedule chart:_

it lays out tasks on a calendar.

Milestone: an event that identifies where we are in the project. Completing a milestone and ending a phase are milestones.

**_Change management: _**

simplest process in PM. still messing up almost every project.

Six steps:

1. Write down the change or request
2. Analyse positive and negative impact of the change
3. Review alternatives
4. Make recommendations
5. Get approvals or rejections
6. If approved implement the change. If not do not

Performing work requires time and resources. If the scope changes, so do the cost and schedule.
