Connections allow to create integrations. 

A connection can be a source, a target or both. 

They can be created in Scribe workbench. 

You can add a source with Configure Source, the destination in Configure Steps. 

We can choose the operation to perform, for instance update/insert. 

_Lookup links_

Lookup links allows to avoid duplicates. Choose a source and a target field and then click on Lookup 

_Data links_

Direct connection from source and target. Choose a source and a target field and then click on Data Link. Can add comments from the lower panel in Data formulas. You can right click on the link and change the formula. 

_Formulas_

Choose a source and a target field and then click on Lookup 

You can do conditional conversion: convert only when specific criteria are met. 

FORMAT(S\#, "\#\#\#-\#\#-\#\#) formats the phone number 

S\# is the field number \# in the source 

Strings values are defined within "" 

_Save/Run/Modify DTS_

If not saved, before running you have to save. 

You can also test the integration. 

To run on the data modified since the last run as a custom query in configure query: 

e.g. SELECT \* FROM Customers WHERE ModifiedOn < :ThisRunDateTime and ModifiedOn \> :LastRunDateTime 

_Automate the DTS in Scribe insight_

tree off the Scribe Console: contains the integrations services. 

The integration process is created in the integration server folder =\> Integration processes. 

From there you can add a new automated process and control the existing ones 

Process event: determines when the process is going to be run (queue, time, etc..) 

Event settings: determines the specific time when the process will run (once, interval, etc..) 

Activation: determines what to do when done: start or pause, set a range when the process will be active 

Alerting: determine how to be alerted from this process
