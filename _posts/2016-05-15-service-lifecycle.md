**ITIL Service lifecycle**

-5 Core Books

_The 5 core books in ITIL each cover one of the Service Management Lifecycle phases:_

Service Strategy

Service Design

Service Transition

Service Operation

Continual Service Improvement

**Lifecycle: 5 Phases**

_Service Strategy_

• Working with the business to plan

• Long and short-tem service needs

_Service Design_

• Planning and architecting services

• Fall within the business' strategy

_Service Transition_

• Moving planned business initiatives to live status

• Retiring old services no longer of value

_Service Operation_

• Managing current services

• Striving for effective and efficient delivery

_Continual Service Improvement_

• Implemented as part of every business process

• Always! We cannot stay where we are

_Strategy design:_make sure that the service we design around the needs are meeting the short term and long term goals

_Service design__:_make sure of the alignment with the goals: which rules needs to be done in order to properly implement the service

_Transition:_makes the service come alive, also sunsetting old services

_Operation:_make sure the processes are delivered consistently and with consistent results

_Continual improvement:_it never goes away, we cannot stay where we are. Even we did everything good, the service still needs to be reviewed and evaluated to make sure it still has viability in the marketplace.

**Benefits of IT IL to the IT Provider**

o Service Management Best Practices

o Lifecycle Approach

- More proficient management of services

o Better integration among.

- Business Services

- IT Functions

- IT Services

o Focus on Value of Service

Processes associated with service design, operation, ..., but we are still looking for improvements through iterations. It allows the processes to not stand still.

It allows better integration for the business and IT. It is there to support the business and support the objectives of other business, it allows to have better ongoing communication.

Value creation and shaping the customer or the business perception of the value of a service. Has value been gained or lost?

**Benefits of ITIL to the Customer**

o Focus on Business Needs

o Services Aligned to Business Activity

o Services Designed to Meet Business Requirements

o Automation in Services

ITIL requires that the business needs are fully understood by the IT organisation, by making sure that the process goes through all the different process phases. This implies better integration with business services.

Alignment to business activity: make sure the services are meeting the demands of the business, the customer and the marketplaces

Meeting business requirements: BR are one of the pain points in IT, cause the business might not know itself the requirements. After the reqs have been approved, there might be a "scope creep" where new reqs are added, affecting delivery plans and estimations.

**Automation & Service Management**

o Service automation can play a significant role in improving effectiveness, efficiency and costs of IT services and in the end provide better value to the customer.

o Opportunities for automation of processes and services should be identified and where possible implemented throughout the services management lifecycle.

Service automation is critical, since we can follow it again and again. When different people not follow a process when doing a procedure we create inconsistencies and waste of time. It helps to drive costs of IT components.

Anywhere we can find a process that can be automated, we are gaining effectiveness, we create values to help resolve problems much faster, disseminate info to the stakeholders faster.

Areas that can benefit from automation include:

o Design and modeling

o Service catalogue

o Pattern recognition and analysis

o Classification, prioritization and routing

o Detection and monitoring

o Optimization

Design and modelling: makes it reproducible

Service catalogue: the catalogue includes all the alive services. When we have automated services that can help to attract prospective customers.

Pattern recognition and analysis: can help drive and understand better what the demands are in relation to a particular service (resources,..)

Classification, prioritisation and routing: prioritise our services, determine which CSF and KPI we have. We can better prepare in terms of disaster recovery

_Detection and monitoring:_

Optimisation: key benefit from automation, so that they are done the most effectively and efficiently

_Governance_

Ensures that policies and strategy are actually implemented, and that required processes are correctly followed.

Governance includes defining roles and their responsibilities, measuring and reporting, and taking necessary actions to resolve any issues identified.

Many orgs now because of falsified info, perceived frauds, scandals, failures, realised the importance of governance.

Governance and Management are not the same thing!

Clear Governance =\> Sound Decisions =\> Policies =\> Guides Quality

Governance determines compliancy
